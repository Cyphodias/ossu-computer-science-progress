# 📘 OSSU Computer Science Progress Tracker

## 👋 Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum**.

**Goals:**

* Build strong computer science foundations
* Avoid shallow, tutorial-based learning
* Graduate with both **skills + credential**
* Track progress publicly for accountability
